Remember that when working with object properties, it's always a good idea to verify the type of data you are dealing with. Using array methods on non-array values can lead to unexpected results or errors, like the one you encountered.\n\nIf you find yourself frequently needing to perform array operations on non-array data structures, consider refactoring your data model to use arrays consistently, or use helper functions to convert non-array values into arrays before using array methods.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
