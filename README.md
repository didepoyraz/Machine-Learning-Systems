# Machine Learning Systems - 2024/2025

This repository contains the completed work for the **Machine Learning Systems** course (INFR11269) for the **2024/2025** academic year. It includes the implementation of machine learning operators, the integration of these operators into an end-to-end system, and the performance optimization of the deployed system.

### Repository Structure

- **[Task-1](./task-1)**: Contains the implementation of a machine learning operator using **PyTorch**, with a focus on GPU programming, performance optimization, and profiling.
  
- **[Task-2](./task-2)**: Includes the integration of the PyTorch operator from Task 1 into an **end-to-end RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) serving pipeline**, including system deployment and optimization.

- **[Resources](./resources)**: Contains helpful resources such as lecture slides, reading materials, code templates, and references related to **GPU programming** and **PyTorch demos**.

### Final Remarks

This repository contains all the work completed for the **Machine Learning Systems** course, including the implementation of machine learning operators and their integration into a distributed system. It demonstrates the application of GPU programming, system deployment, and performance optimization techniques in the context of machine learning systems.
